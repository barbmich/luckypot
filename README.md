# Luckypot

Luckypot is an innovative solution for organizing potlucks.

It allows the users to:

- Create their own events, sharing information about them
- Invite guests, who can provide their availability
- Add meals to a board, which can be picked by people to be brought
- Search for recipes - through the Spoonacular API
- Send messages to other participants and see the chat history
- See a list of meals brought to potlucks and all meals tasted, and add them as favorites

This is the collaborative final project for the Lighthouse Labs July cohort.

The project can be seen [here](http://luckypot-app.heroku.com)!
