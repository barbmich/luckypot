# Luckypot

Luckypot is an innovative solution for organizing potlucks.

It allows the users to:

- Create their own events, sharing information about them
- Invite guests, who can provide their availability
- Add meals to a board, which can be picked by people to be brought
- Search for recipes - through the Spoonacular API
- Send messages to other partecipants and see the chat history
- See a list of meals brought to potlucks and all meals tasted, and add them as favorites

This is the collaborative final project for the Lighthouse Labs July cohort.

### Tech stack

- Back-end: Node, Express, WS, PostgreSQL
- Libraries/Dependencies: React router, Axios, SASS, Bootstrap, MomentJS
